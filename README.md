<h1 align='center'>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock ✊✋✌️🤏🖖</h1>
This is the infamous game brought to popularity with the TV show The Big Bang Theory.

### Note from the creator, Sam Kass:

<blockquote><i>“I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability. This version is also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives.”</i></blockquote>

## The Logic

- Scissors cuts Paper.
- Paper covers Rock.
- Rock crushes Lizard.
- Lizard poisons Spock.
- Spock smashes Scissors.
- Scissors decapitate Lizard.
- Lizard eats Paper.
- Paper disproves Spock.
- Spock vaporizes Rock.
- (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.
